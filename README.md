# SH-6775680: Show IP Address With PHP

## Description
SH-6775680 is a simple PHP script that allows you to display the IP address of the client accessing your website. This script can be useful for tracking user activities, analyzing website traffic, or implementing IP-based restrictions.

## How It Works
The SH-6775680 script utilizes the `$_SERVER` superglobal variable in PHP, specifically the `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` value, to retrieve the IP address of the client making the request. This IP address represents the user's device or the proxy server they are connecting through.

## Installation
To use the SH-6775680 script, follow these steps:

1. Create a new PHP file on your server or open an existing one.
2. Copy the contents of the SH-6775680 script and paste it into your PHP file.
3. Save the file and upload it to your server.

## Usage
To display the IP address of the client, simply execute the PHP file containing the SH-6775680 script. The script will retrieve the IP address and output it on the webpage.

You can customize the appearance of the IP address display by modifying the HTML or CSS code surrounding the `echo` statement in the script.

## Example
Here's an example implementation of the SH-6775680 script:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Show IP Address</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styles for IP address display */
        .ip-address {
            font-size: 18px;
            font-weight: bold;
            color: #333;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <p>Your IP address:</p>
    <div class="ip-address">
        <?php
        // Include the SH-6775680 script
        include 'sh-6775680.php';

        // Execute the script to display the IP address
        ?>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the IP address will be displayed within the `<div>` element with the class "ip-address". You can style it according to your preference by modifying the CSS rules in the `<style>` section.

## Notes
- The `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` value may not always accurately represent the user's actual IP address, especially if they are accessing the website through a proxy or VPN.
- Additional server-side configurations or considerations may be required to ensure the correct retrieval of IP addresses in certain environments (e.g., load balancers, reverse proxies).
- This script only provides the client's IP address; it does not provide information about their geolocation or other details.
